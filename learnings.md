  2. Value: in input 
   The value attribute specifies the value of an <input> element.

The value attribute is used differently for different input types:

For "button", "reset", and "submit" - it defines the text on the button
For "text", "password", and "hidden" - it defines the initial (default) value of the input field
For "checkbox", "radio", "image" - it defines the value associated with the input (this is also the value that is sent on submit)
Note: The value attribute cannot be used with <input type="file">.

     <label> tag is used to create labels for items in a user interface. Used within <input> tags on a form, 
     the <label> tag is additionally useful because it extends the clickable area of control elements, like buttons.
